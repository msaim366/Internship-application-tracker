# Internship-application-tracker

This project is a backend-focused web application which is designed for users to help track their internships and job applications in a structured and maintainable way.

The aim of this project is to demonstrate core backend engineering skills, along with clean architecture, data modeling, validation and API design.

## Tech Stack

      - Python
      - Flask
      - SQLite
      - SQLAlchemy

## Features

      - Create, update, and delete internship and job applications
      - Track application status (Applied, interview, Rejected, Offer)
      - Store application notes and dates
      - RESTful API endpoints to manage application

## Project Focus

This project will focus on backend design, maintainability, and clarity rather than UI complexity.

## Why this project

Tracking applications manually results in an error-prone and unstructured application. This application aims to provide a clean backend system that can be extended with additional features for e.g, authentication, analytics, or a frontend interface.

## Status

    1. Project setup and design phase
